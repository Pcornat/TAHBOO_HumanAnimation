# [TAHBOO](https://github.com/Pcornat/TAHBOO_Unity) submodule

## WARNING
In this project we use the ART Tracker system, the humand tracking system. So, as we use this system, we have to use the DTrackSDK software. Thank you for your understanding.

## Description

This submodule is the DLL that will be used to animate our human inside Unity with different AR material (such as ART Motion Capture, Kinect and the Intel RGBD camera).
